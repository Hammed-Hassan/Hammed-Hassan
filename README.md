#                     Hi there 👋🏽, I'm Hammed Hassan

**Data Analyst & Builder | Turning data into solutions with Python, SQL, and Power BI**
#

### About Me 👩🏽‍💻
I am a data analyst and problem-solver with a passion for making sense of a large junk of data. I love the challenge of turning unstructured information into a meaningful story that guides better decisions and helps businesses predict the future.

My work goes beyond technical analysis. I believe the true value of data lies in its ability to empower people, and I excel at communicating complex insights in a way that is clear and actionable for non-technical teams. I've successfully collaborated on projects across industries, from sales to marketing, using my skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI to deliver impactful results. For instance, in a consumer electronics project, I used my analysis to pinpoint key areas for maximizing sales and profit, helping a company focus its marketing strategy where it mattered most.

Ultimately, I am a builder who is dedicated to using data to solve real-world problems. I bring a mix of technical skill, critical thinking, and a strong collaborative spirit to every project, ensuring that every insight is not only accurate but also easy to understand and act upon.
